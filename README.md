# How It's Made:
Tech used: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, EJS, Bootstrap, MVC, Cyclic, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The app utilizes express with node.js for the backend for all of the controllers and routes to direct the flow and operatins of the fullstack web app, thus making node anmd express the 'brains' of the operation. This server code is deployed via cyclic. Our 'brain' connects to a mongo database using mongoose for the modals and schemas to keep track of the data utilized by the app, from usernames to projects to (salted) passwords. THe backend then uses the data from the database and passes that informatiopn to our views. With EJS, the views is our rendering part of the app that allows us to plug our data into and render it into HTML that we can send back to the user. The views are styled with bootstrap 5 for a nice clean and responsive design. 

# Lessons Learned:
The following are just some of the things I was able to learn more about and gain more experince with from building this fullstack web app:
+Document-oriented database models with MongoDB and the flexibility it provides
<br>+Building scalable and efficient web applications with Node.js
<br>+Application structure and HTTP request handling with Express for defining routes, handling parameters, and rendering templates
<br>+Using variables and control structures in HTML to generate dynamic pages with data from the application via EJS
<br>+Responsive and mobile-first web application design with bootstrap
<br>+As well as many cool and fun concepts like authentication and RESTful API development to name a few
